## About Me

Hey, I'm Sameer—a computer science student from Nepal with a deep curiosity for how things work and how to make them better.

I spend most of my time building web applications, experimenting with machine learning models, and exploring cybersecurity. I'm fascinated by the challenge of writing code that's not just functional, but secure, scalable, and maintainable. Whether it's designing a clean API, optimizing database queries, or pentesting a network, I'm driven by the process of solving complex problems.

Beyond code, I love playing football. There's something about the strategy, teamwork, and unpredictability of the game that keeps me coming back—and honestly, it teaches me a lot about collaboration and staying sharp under pressure.

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Every project is an opportunity to push my limits and try something new.

## Areas of Focus

**Software Architecture**  
I care deeply about how systems are structured. I study design patterns, practice SOLID principles, and think carefully about how to build applications that can grow without becoming unmaintainable. Microservices, clean separation of concerns, and thoughtful API design are all things I actively work on.

**Cybersecurity & Red Teaming**  
Security isn't an afterthought for me—it's part of the foundation. I practice penetration testing, study common vulnerabilities, and work on understanding how systems can be exploited so I can build them better. I'm currently preparing for OSCP and sharpening my red team skills.

**Object-Oriented Programming**  
Writing clean, modular code is something I take seriously. I focus on encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and all the principles that make code reusable and easy to reason about. Good OOP makes everything else easier.

**Network Engineering**  
Understanding how data moves across networks is critical for both development and security. I work with TCP/IP, routing protocols, network hardening, and infrastructure design to build systems that are reliable and secure from the ground up.

**CI/CD & Automation**  
I believe in automating repetitive tasks. I work with GitHub Actions and Jenkins to streamline deployments, run tests automatically, and keep development workflows efficient.

## Currently Learning

Right now, I'm diving deeper into:

- Building intelligent applications with LangChain and exploring how LLMs can enhance real-world systems
- Advanced software architecture patterns and system design for large-scale applications
- Red team techniques, exploitation methodologies, and offensive security strategies
- Cross-platform mobile development with Flutter to expand beyond web
- Automated deployment pipelines and infrastructure as code
- Advanced networking concepts, protocols, and security practices
