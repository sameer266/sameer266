## Hey there 👋

I'm Sameer, a computer science student based in Nepal who's genuinely obsessed with understanding how software works—and more importantly, how it breaks.

Most days you'll find me knee-deep in code, whether that's building full-stack web apps, tinkering with machine learning models, or trying to break into systems (ethically, of course). I get a kick out of that moment when everything clicks—when a complex architecture makes sense, when a vulnerability reveals itself, or when a piece of code does exactly what it's supposed to do.

Here's what really drives me: I don't just want to write code that works. I want to write code that's secure from the ground up, that scales gracefully, and that other developers can actually understand six months from now. Call it a healthy obsession with clean architecture and security-first thinking.

When I'm not staring at a terminal, you'll probably find me on a football field. I've always loved the sport—the way it demands both individual skill and seamless teamwork. It's funny how much football has taught me about code: stay adaptable, communicate clearly, and sometimes the best play is the simplest one.

I'm a big believer in learning by doing. Every project I take on is a chance to break something, fix it, and come out knowing more than I did before.

## What I'm Focused On

**Building Secure Systems**  
Security isn't something I bolt on at the end—it's baked into how I think about architecture. I spend time learning how attackers think, studying penetration testing methodologies, and understanding common vulnerabilities. Right now I'm working toward OSCP certification while practicing red team techniques. The goal isn't just to find holes in systems, but to build things that don't have those holes in the first place.

**Software Architecture That Scales**  
I'm fascinated by the challenge of designing systems that can grow. That means diving into design patterns, understanding SOLID principles, and thinking hard about separation of concerns. I read about microservices, study API design, and try to write code that future me (and other developers) won't curse at. Good architecture is invisible when it works, but you feel it when it doesn't.

**Network Fundamentals**  
Understanding how data actually moves between machines has changed how I think about building applications. I work with TCP/IP, routing protocols, and network security because whether you're deploying a web app or securing infrastructure, you need to know what's happening at the network level. It's the foundation everything else sits on.

**Clean, Maintainable Code**  
I take object-oriented programming seriously. Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction—these aren't just buzzwords to me. They're tools for writing code that's modular, testable, and actually makes sense. I've learned the hard way that clever code isn't the same as good code. Readable always wins.

**Automation & CI/CD**  
If I'm doing something more than twice, I'm thinking about how to automate it. I work with GitHub Actions and Jenkins to build pipelines that test code, catch bugs early, and deploy reliably. Good automation means I can focus on solving interesting problems instead of repetitive tasks.

## What I'm Learning Now

These are the things I'm actively diving into:

- **LangChain & AI Applications** – Exploring how to build practical tools powered by large language models, not just experiments but things people can actually use
- **Advanced System Design** – Studying how large-scale systems handle millions of users, how they stay reliable, and what design decisions make that possible
- **Offensive Security** – Going deeper into exploitation techniques, understanding attack vectors, and preparing for OSCP
- **Flutter Development** – Expanding beyond web to build cross-platform mobile apps that feel native
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Learning to automate infrastructure deployment and management
- **Network Security** – Understanding not just how networks work, but how to harden them against attacks
